Done in the spring semester of 2020.

## Homeworks
### hw01 - ascii85
Encoding to and decoding from ascii85. All tests passed including bonus for usage of fixed width integer types.

### hw02-old - ascii art
Prints text as ascii art. Takes length of line as an argument.

### hw02 - poker
Evaluating a game of poker. All but one tests passed, failed test was to detect invalid instances on input.

### hw03 - 32-bit CPU emulator
Emulating a 32-bit processor. One failed test and a single valgrind violation, never found out where.

### hw04 - Analyzing data from DIMES project
Finding shortest path in graph constructed from data from DIMES project. The path is then returned in GraphWiz compatible format. All but one tests passed, problem is when graph has a single node and no edges with wanted path being between from and to the only node. In that case, the program returns -1 and prints an error. It should end with 0 and return empty path.

### hw05 - find
Program that emulates functionality of UN*X's find command. Searches for files based on given criteria and returnes them in a specified order. Mostly works, 6.43/10.
