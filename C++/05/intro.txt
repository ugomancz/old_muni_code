# Operators and IO

The main topics for week 5 are operator overloading (which will
build on what we learned about function and method overloading in
week 4). The second topic for this week will be IO: we will look at
formatted input and output and at reading and writing files.

Demonstrations:

 1. ‹arithmetic› – introduction to operator overloading,
 2. ‹relational› – implementing equality and ordering,
 3. ‹access›     – dereference, indexing and other access ops,
 4. ‹convert›    – conversion and assignment,
 5. ‹files›      – opening files, reading and writing strings
 6. ‹streams›    – from values to strings and back
 7. ‹format›     – overloading formatting operators

Elementary Exercises:

 1. ‹cartesian›  – complex numbers in algebraic form,
 2. ‹force›      – composing and scaling forces,
 3. ‹forcefmt›   – vectors redux, this time with IO

Free Exercises:

 1. ‹poly›       – polynomials with addition and multiplication
 2. ‹csv›        – parse comma-separated numeric data
 3. ‹set›        – a set of integers with set operators,

Graded Exercises:

 1. ‹polar›      – complex numbers in polar form,
 2. ‹rational›   – rational numbers with ordering,
 3. ‹tmpfile›    – an auto-erasing temporary file
 4. ‹nibble›     – a pointer-like class for sub-byte access,
 5. ‹grep›       – print matching lines
 6. ‹fixnum›     – more numbers, this time with a parser.
