# P. Practice Exams

This directory contains 2 practice exams, which you can submit
freely. When you do this for real, you will have 3.5 hours to read
the spec, implement it and submit the solution. Since the tasks are
expected to take you about 2 hours or less, the submission deadline
will be «strict» and will not be extended.

The «practice» exam can be submitted at any time, and will be
evaluated immediately after submission. Unlike the real exam, it
will be evaluated every time you submit (a real exam will only be
evaluated once, using the last submission before the deadline).

To submit a practice exam, use
