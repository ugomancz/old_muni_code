## Code Quality

As mentioned earlier, when you submit your code for teacher review,
it will be graded A–E. The following criteria apply.

### Vices

This is a list of things your code should not do, and the best grade
that is possible if they make an appearance. In all cases, only
‘nontrivial’ instances matter, but unfortunately, there is no
obvious line between trivial and nontrivial. Your reviewer's
judgment will apply.

 • Code duplication: this is a very serious problem, both when the
   code is literal copy&paste and when there are minor modifications
   between the copies. Two copies of a moderately-sized code block,
   or 3 copies of a short block will cap your grade at «D». More
   duplication than than that, and it's an automatic «E».
   
   Code which is highly redundant (multiple implementations of the
   same concept or pattern, even if not literally copied) is still a
   problem, including duplication of the standard library. In this
   case, the grade cap is «D».
   
 • Spaghetti: another common and very serious problem, often paired
   with the previous. Long functions, an excessive number of local
   variables, non-obvious side effects which affect control flow
   down the line, functions which do too many things at once. One
   instance caps your grade at «D», multiple guarantee an «E».
   
 • Bad naming caps your grade at «D» unless it's an isolated
   incident (in which case, «C» is a possibility). Includes:
   ◦ meaningless names – single-letter global variables, names which
     say nothing about the purpose of the thing (‹tmp1› through
     ‹tmp7›, ‹tmp›, ‹tmptmp›, ‹pom›, ‹pomoc›, …),
   ◦ names which are not English nor established placeholders or
     abbreviations (these are fine: ‹a›, ‹b› for arguments of binary
     operators, ‹i›, ‹j› for loop variables, etc.),
   ◦ overlong, completely redundant names for local objects
     (‹first_plus_operand›, ‹loop_index_variable_1›).
   
 • Inappropriate data types, data structures or algorithms: using
   building blocks which do not fit the intended purpose makes
   programs hard to follow and reason about, and often also leads to
   poor performance. Abuse of strings is especially common. Caps the
   grade at «C» or «D» depending on seriousness and extent of the
   problem.

If your code is free of the above vices, it will get a «C» or a
better grade, depending on the virtues described below.

### Virtues

To earn a grade better than «C», your code should be free from vices
and also demonstrate some of the following virtues.

 • Cohesion and orthogonality: each code unit (class, function, …)
   does one well-defined thing and has a clear and fitting name.
   Required for «B».
   
 • Good naming: names should be clear, descriptive, respect word
   categories (based around verbs for functions and nouns for types
   and variables), be free from spelling or grammatical errors.
   Names should not be redundant – context matters. The verbosity of
   a name should be inversely proportional to its scope. Do not
   repeat established context (no ‹list::list_length›). Required for
   «B».
   
 • Comments: each non-obvious code unit should have a comment
   concisely describing what it does and why. Required for «A».
   Additionally, if you are aiming at «A», comments should explain
   why is each non-obvious piece of code correct.
   
 • Preconditions: each function should clearly state its
   preconditions, preferably in executable form (‹assert›).
   Required for «A».
