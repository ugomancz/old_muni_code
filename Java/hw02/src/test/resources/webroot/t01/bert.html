     <h1>How Google’s Bert Update Will Affect Content Marketing</h1>
    </header>

<p>Google announced that it has been rolling out a new update called Bert. 

    I know what you are thinking… does this update really matter? Should I even spend time learning about it? 
        
    Well, Bert will affect 1 in 10 search queries. 
        
    To give you an idea of how big of an update this is, it’s the biggest update since Google released RankBrain.</p>

<h2>So, what is Bert?</h2>
<p>Bert stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

You are probably wondering, what the heck does that mean, right?

Google, in essence, has adjusted its algorithm to better understand natural language processing.

Just think of it this way: you could put a flight number into Google and they typically show you the flight status. Or a calculator may come up when you type in a math equation. Or if you put a stock symbol in, you’ll get a stock chart.

Or even a simpler example is: you can start typing into Google and its autocomplete feature can figure out what you are searching for before you even finishing typing it in.

But Google has already had all of that figured out before Bert. So let’s look at some examples of Bert in action.</p>
